## Getting started

Hosting-as-a-Business (HaaB) is a framework designed to help you understand what it takes to start and operate a hosting‑related business. It offers general guidance, mental models, and practical considerations for entering the hosting industry. This is not a strict recipe, legal advice, or a complete business plan. Instead, it provides a structured starting point to think through your idea, evaluate the market, and make informed decisions as you build.

This documentation serves as your main entry point into the framework. You will find high‑level concepts, actionable steps, and references to more detailed sections covering business fundamentals, technology, operations, pricing, and customer experience.

  <Expandable title="Not an exhaustive business plan" default-open="false">

## Simple planning checklist

Here is a lightweight example of what an early planning checklist might look like:

```text
- Define your target customer group.
- Choose your initial hosting model.
- Estimate your monthly operating costs.
- Outline your support expectations.
- Identify at least one differentiator.
```

This is not a predefined template. Adapt it to match your goals and the scale of the business you want to build.

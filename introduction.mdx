## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to initialize a new documentation project:

```javascript
const sprybear = require('sprybear-docs');

const docs = new sprybear.Documentation({
  repository: 'my-org/my-repo',
  branch: 'main',
  output: './docs'
});

docs.build();
```

This configuration creates a new documentation instance connected to your GitHub repository, ready to generate and deploy your docs.
